This Hackpad is a custom 5-key macropad built using the Seeed XIAO RP2040.
It includes per-key SK6812 MINI reverse-mount RGB LEDs, a rotary encoder, and a 0.91" OLED display.

I built this macropad to make my daily work easier. 
I use a lot of shortcuts and wanted a small device where I can press one button instead of remembering key combinations.
This project helped me understand how hardware and software work together.

I made macropad to make my daily workflow smoother by giving me singlee press access to shortcuts and custom actions I use often, instead of complex keyboard combinations. It was also a personal learning project to improve my skills in PCB design, microcontroller integration, LED routing, and 3D case design.

To use it, just flash the firmware to the XIAO RP2040 and connect it to your computer with a USB cable. The keys can be programmed for shortcuts or macros, and the rotary encoder can control things like volume.
